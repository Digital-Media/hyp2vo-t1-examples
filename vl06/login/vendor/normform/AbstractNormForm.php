/**
 * The object oriented and template based norm form is used to gather, validate and process form data in a flexible way.
 *
 * This abstract class represents a well known process of gathering, validating and processing form data within a single
 * PHP structure. To use it, simple extend this class and implement the abstract methods isValid() (for validation) and
 * business() for processing/business logic. Then create an object of your subclass, supply a View object and start
 * the process by calling normForm.
 * The initial call will show the form supplied by the View object. Submitted form data will then be validated by your
 * implementation of isValid(). Occurring error messages can be passed on to the View object and displayed in the
 * template output. Once validation is passed, the data entered in the form can be processed in business() in any
 * suitable way. By returning a new View object in business() the processed data can be displayed flexibly (in a new
 * template or in a separate file). If nothing is returned the current (form) view also can be used to show output.
