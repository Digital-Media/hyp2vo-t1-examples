* Lecturer: [Wolfgang Hochleitner](https://github.com/hochleitner)

Files in the ``master`` branch will change continuously throughout the summer semester. Once all lectures are completed, a tag will be created for the according semester and this state will be available for download as a [release](https://github.com/Digital-Media/hm2vl-examples/releases).

## Usage

1. Get a development webserver stack with PHP enabled (e.g. [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/i)).
2. Get a proper PHP IDE (e.g. [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)).
3. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP-file into your server's document root.
4. Open the files in your webbrowser.

* Use your PHP IDE to examine the contents of the files and see how they work.
