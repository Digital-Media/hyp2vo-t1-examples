# HYP2VO Hypermedia 2 Part 1 Server-side Programming Examples

These are the code examples accompanying the lecture notes for HYP2VO Hypermedia 2 Part 1 Server-side Programming. Topics revolve around serverside web development with PHP.

* Lecturer: [Wolfgang Hochleitner](https://github.com/hochleitner)

Files in the `main` branch will change continuously throughout the summer semester. Once all lectures are completed, a tag will be created for the respective semester, and this state will be available for download as a [release](https://github.com/Digital-Media/hyp2vo-t1-examples/releases).

## Usage

1. Get a development webserver stack with PHP enabled (e.g., the [fhooe-web-dock](https://github.com/Digital-Media/fhooe-web-dock) Docker containers or the [fhooe-webdev](https://github.com/Digital-Media/fhooe-webdev) Vagrant image).
2. Get a proper PHP IDE (e.g., [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)).
3. Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file into your server's document root, the Docker or Vagrant shared folder.
4. Open the files in your web browser. The examples for each lecture are in the respective folder (e.g., `vl01` for lecture 1).

* Use your PHP IDE to examine the contents of the files and see how they work.
* Pull the repository regularly to get the latest changes.
